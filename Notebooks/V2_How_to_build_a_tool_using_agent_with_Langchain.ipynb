        "# How to build a tool-using agent with LangChain\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook takes you through how to use LangChain to augment an OpenAI model with access to external tools. In particular, you'll be able to create LLM agents that use custom tools to answer user queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is Langchain?\n",
        "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Their framework enables you to build layered LLM-powered applications that are context-aware and able to interact dynamically with their environment as agents, leading to simplified code for you and a more dynamic user experience for your customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why do LLMs need to use Tools?\n",
        "One of the most common challenges with LLMs is overcoming the lack of recency and specificity in their training data - answers can be out of date, and they are prone to hallucinations given the huge variety in their knowledge base. Tools are a great method of allowing an LLM to answer within a controlled context that draws on your existing knowledge bases and internal APIs - instead of trying to prompt engineer the LLM all the way to your intended answer, you allow it access to tools that it calls on dynamically for info, parses, and serves to customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Providing LLMs access to tools can enable them to answer questions with context directly from search engines, APIs or your own databases. Instead of answering directly, an LLM with access to tools can perform intermediate steps to gather relevant information. Tools can also be used in combination. [For example](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/examples/mrkl_chat.html), a language model can be made to use a search tool to lookup quantitative information and a calculator to execute calculations.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **LLM Agent with History:** Provide the LLM with access to previous steps in the conversation.\n",
        "- **Knowledge Base:** Create a knowledge base of \"Stuff You Should Know\" podcast episodes, to be accessed through a tool.\n",

        "- **Output Parser:** A method of parsing the output from the prompt. If the LLM produces output using certain headers, you can enable complex interactions where variables are generated by the LLM in their response and passed into the next step of the chain ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/output_parsers.html)).\n",
        "- **LLM Chain:** A Chain brings together a prompt template with an LLM that will execute it - in this case we'll be using ```gpt-3.5-turbo``` but this framework can be used with OpenAI completions models, or other LLMs entirely ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html)).\n",
        "- **Tool:** An external service that the LLM can use to retrieve information or execute commands should the user require it ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools.html)).\n",
        "- **Agent:** The glue that brings all of this together, an agent can call multiple LLM Chains, each with their own tools. Agents can be extended with your own logic to allow retries, error handling and any other methods you choose to add reliability to your application ([docs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html)).\n",

But now that I've read this crime scene clean up article on our fairsitehouselworks.com, I realized just how far off the mark some of the details were on that. Was it pretty far? Yeah, a little bit. Have you seen Sunshine Cleaning? No, but from the previous, that one looks pretty far off the mark, too. I remember seeing them carrying out, like, a mattress, just like Mrs. Brady spring cleaning type outfits. Yeah, you remember those? She had, like, the little du rag and she had the little clam diggers rolled up and, like, some Converse on, just cute as a button. That was one of the jokes of the scenes, actually. They were carrying out this Amy Adams and the other girl carrying out this nasty, like, bloody mattress, and one of them dropped her end and the other one fell on the bloody stain and it was just like it's really good movie, though, actually. Yeah, it was great. Is it by the people who made Loma Sunshine or am I just confusing that? Because Sunshine is the name. It's a little indie, though. Alan Arkin was in it, so maybe so I wonder. It's good. All right, well, both of these movies are utter frauds when it comes to the details. Right, Chuck? Yeah, for the most part. Okay. Let's talk about Crime Scene clean up, the real stuff, because there's nothing cute or about it. It's actually horrific work, and it takes a very specific kind of person. And those people last an average of about eight months before they get burned out in this business. Right? Yeah. All right. So it's actually called it's part of the cleaning industry.

Oh, wait, what is balancing a checkbook mean? Seriously? Yeah. Thank God for my wife. So another reason you might avoid a bank is philosophically. There may be a longstanding distrust of banks in your family that you don't want to put your money in, or you may just want to be like, you know what? I don't want to take part in this modern society. I want to kind of drop out a bit. And a really good first move is to shut your bank account down. That's a big statement. Oh, yeah, it is. But a lot of people that are underbanked and don't have accounts aren't there on purpose. It's not some philosophical statement. A lot of times it's simply because they are poor and they don't have a lot of alternatives. Yeah. And the other thing about not having a bank account, not only do you not have a bank account, you also are, like, basically just avoiding banks altogether. There's plenty of other things that banks offer, like loans and mortgage, lollipops, stuff like that. Yeah. Maybe some free nasty coffee. So when you don't have a banking account, that's like the most basic unit of the banking world. Right. If you don't have that, you obviously aren't going to be exposed to all these other things that can help. Things like build your credit history through like a revolving loan or a mortgage or a car loan or something like that that you can build up your credit for and ultimately save money. So when you don't have a bank account, for whatever reason, you are effectively out of the banking system. The problem is you can live parallel to the banking system outside of it, but it can be really dangerous, especially if you're just dealing with cash, because that cash has to stay somewhere, whether it's on you or in your mattress or in a coffee can in your backyard. You're exposed for having that readily available to anybody who finds it or comes into your house with a gun to get it. Yes.\n",

Most cases these days you have well, I don't know about most cases, but in many cases you have automatic deposits of your work checks. Sure. A lot of people pay their bills wirelessly, online, directly from their bank. You might have a student loan, you might have a car loan, you might have your house mortgage, you might pay your credit card bills. All this stuff is running through a bank, most likely. And you would think it's probably impossible to not have a bank account these days. And I would say pretty much all Americans have them. Not true. Well, pretty much all Americans do. Like 93% do.

About 9 million people last year in 2015 did not have bank accounts. 9 million people is a lot of people. No, it really is. And apparently that's household sorry, not people. Yeah, right. You're that is a big distinction, too. And the FDIC said, man, that's the lowest since we've been tracking this by far. And someone said, well, how long have you been tracking this? They said, well, the last six years. Really? Yeah, which I'm like. Really? That's when they started tracking it, but apparently so 2009. So if you want another number, the 9 million American households don't have bank accounts at all, then there are 25 million households in addition to that. So that makes almost like 34 million households, which that's a substantial number at this point. Sure. The 25 million are what's called underbanked, meaning they may have a bank account, but they don't use the bank account. Yeah. They don't use it because they are probably afraid of overdraft fees. Or they have maybe a bank account that got grandfathered in so that they don't have to pay minimum amount fees. And who knows? There's all sorts of reasons for people to not use a bank account that they have, but probably cheap among them is overdressed, which you'll talk more about. Yeah. And the majority of these underbank people in the United States are poor, usually. A lot of times they're minorities, a lot of times they're less educated. And these communities, there's a few reasons why they may not want to use a bank one. Maybe they don't trust banks. And if you look in the history of the United States or certainly even we're just talking about the Wells Fargo scandal, when you see stuff like that on the news, it should be upsetting to everyone. But obviously if you're poor and you don't have a lot of money, that may scare you into not wanting to use a bank at all. Right? Yeah.\n",
